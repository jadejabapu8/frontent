     <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 90px; column-count: 2; column-gap: 45px;"> The Rajputs are a large community in the Indian subcontinent, traditionally associated with warriorhood and ruling classes. 
        The term "Rajput" is derived from the Sanskrit "rajaputra," meaning "son of a king". 
        They are known for their bravery, loyalty, and chivalry, and historically ruled over numerous princely states in Rajasthan and other parts of India. 
        Rajput clans are diverse, claiming descent from various lineages and often tracing their origins back to ancient solar and lunar dynasties, 
        or even claiming an Agnikula (fire-born) origin.
