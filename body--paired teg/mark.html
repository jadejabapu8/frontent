    <p>Rajputana history encompasses the rise and rule of Rajput clans in India, particularly from the 6th to the 12th centuries. They are known for their warrior traditions and their role in resisting various invasions, including those of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughals. The term <mark>"Rajputana"</mark> itself was coined by the British, but it became a retrospective term for the region and its history.
